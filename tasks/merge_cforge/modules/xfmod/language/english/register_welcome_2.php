		1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
		 
		A person's use of Novell Forge and any of its Services(as defined below) at
		any time is subject to Novell Forge's then-current Terms of Service(\"TOS\"),
		which may be updated from time to time as set forth below. Each user can
		review the then-current TOS at any time at:
		".ICMS_URL."/modules/xfmod/tos/tos.php.  In addition, each user's use of
		particular Services may be subject to specific guidelines or rules
		(\"Service-specific Rules\") posted from time to time and incorporated by this
		reference into the TOS.  A user's use of  Novell Forge and/or its Services
		constitutes full acceptance of and agreement to the TOS; if a user does not
		accept our TOS, he or she is not granted rights to use Novell Forge or any of
		its Services, as defined herein, and should refrain from accessing
		Novell Forge and its Services.
		 
		To update the TOS or any Service-specific Rules, we will both post the
		changed version and its effective date at
		".ICMS_URL."/modules/xfmod/tos/tos.php.  Concurrently with any change to the
		core TOS, we will email notice of the change to known users at least 15 days
		(or such shorter or longer time as mandated by law or any judicial or
		government body) in advance.  If we change any Service-specific Rules, we
		will post the changed version on the location where those Service-specific
		Rules normally appear,  reference the change on the primary page for that
		Service and include a link to the previous version of the rules.
		 
		Novell Forge reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify
		or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, Novell Forge or any Service
		thereon(or any part thereof) with notice to users and the public as
		described above, or immediately in the event of technical difficulties.
		Novell Forge shall not be liable to any user or other third party for any
		such modification, suspension or discontinuance except as expressly provided
		herein.
		 
		2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE; NO WEB ACCESS
		 
		Novell Forge is a website owned and operated by Novell, Inc., for
		the purpose of fostering software development and content creation under
		Open-Source Initiative(\"OSI\")-approved licenses or other arrangements
		relating to software and/or content development that may be approved by
		Novell Forge(the \"Purpose\").  Novell Forge currently offers users access to a
		rich collection of on-line resources for Open Source  software  development
		and content creation, including various  communications tools, source code
		control and project management tools, online forums, shopping services,
		personalized content and branded programming through its network of
		properties(collectively, the \"Services\").  To use the Services, each user
		must independently obtain access to the World Wide Web, either directly or
		through devices that access Web-based content, and pay any and all service
		fees or equipment costs associated with such access.
		 
		3. REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS
		 
		If required by the site in question, each user must:(a) provide true,
		accurate, current and complete information on the Service's registration
		form(collectively, the \"Registration Data\") and(b) maintain and promptly
		update the Registration Data as necessary. If, after investigation, we have
		reasonable grounds to suspect that any user's information is untrue,
		inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate that
		user's account and prohibit any and all current or future use of the
		Services(or any portion thereof) by that user other than as expressly
		provided herein.
		 
		Each user will receive a password and account designation upon completing
		the Service's registration process and is wholly responsible for maintaining
		the confidentiality thereof and wholly liable for all activities occurring
		thereunder.    Novell Forge cannot and will not be liable for any loss or
		damage arising from a user's failure to comply with this Section, including
		any loss or damage arising from any user's failure to(a) immediately notify
		Novell Forge of any unauthorized use of his or her password or account or any
		other breach of security and(b) ensure that he or she exits from his or her
		account at the end of each session.

		responsibility of the person from which such Content originated. This means
		that the user, and not Novell Forge, is entirely responsible for all Content
		that he or she uploads, posts, emails or otherwise transmits via Novell Forge

		reasonably deems not to fulfill the Purpose. In addition, Novell Forge shall
		have the right(but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse or
		delete any Content which it reasonably considers to violate the TOS or be
		otherwise illegal.  Novell Forge, in its sole and absolute discretion, may
		preserve Content and may also disclose Content if required to do so by law
		or judicial or governmental mandate or as reasonably determined necessary by
		us to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Novell Forge, its
		users and the public. Novell Forge does not control the Content posted via
		the Service and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or
		quality of such Content. Under no circumstances will Novell Forge be liable
		in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, liability for any
		errors or omissions in any Content or for any loss or damage of any kind
		incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed or otherwise
		transmitted via Novell Forge or any Service thereon.
		 
		Each user, by using Novell Forge or any Service, may be exposed to Content
		that is offensive, indecent or objectionable.   Each user must evaluate, and
		bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any
		reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content.
