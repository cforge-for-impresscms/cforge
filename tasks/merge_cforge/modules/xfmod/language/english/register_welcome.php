		<p>
		Novell Forge would like to extend an invitation to host the
		<A href=\"http://www.opensource.org\" target=\"developer\">Open Source</a> project(s) of any interested developer for no price and
		with no catch.
		</p>
		 
		<p><strong>The Process</strong>
		 
		<p>
		Registering a project with Novell Forge is an easy process, but we do require
		a reasonable amount of information in order to automate things
		as much as possible and present your project(s) adequately. Registering
		project consists of the three steps:
		<ol>
		<li>Submitting a request
		<li>Approval of the request
		<li>Setting up your project's account
		</ol>
		</p>
		 
		<p>
		Currently, you are going to proceed with the first step of the
		process. It should take about 10 minutes. After that, please allow
		several days for our review of the request. If it complies
		with our requirements for hosting(see the next step), your
		project will be approved, and you will receive e-mail
		with directions for future steps.
		</p>
		 
		<p>
		During signup, we will present you with some legal documents
		regarding your account with us. Please do not
		ignore these; they are very important to you and your project.
		</p>");
