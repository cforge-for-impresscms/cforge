Novell Forge offers a full suite of services for your hosted project(s). If
you haven't already, please be sure to browse the most recent revision of
these services.
</p>

<p>
<b>Use of Project Account</b>
</p>

<p>
The space provided to you on this server is given for the expressed purpose of
Open Source development or, in the case of web sites, the advancement of
Open Source. For more information, please read the Novell Forge Terms of
Service (\"Terms of Service\").
</p>

<p>
<b>Creative Freedom</b>
</p>

<p>
It is our intent to allow you creative freedom on your project. For our legal protection and yours, there are
limits. Details about these restrictions are described in the
Terms of Service.
</p>

<p>
<b>Advertisements</b>
</p>

<p>
You may not place any revenue-generating advertisements on the Novell Forge site.
</p>

<p>
<b>Open Source/Rights to Code</b>
</p>

<p>
You will be presented with a choice of Open Source approved licenses for
your project. You will still own the code, but these licenses also
allow us to make your code available to the general public. Although you may
choose to stop hosting your project with us at any time, the nature of these licenses
will allow us to continue to make your code available. Details about content
ownership are described in the Terms of Service.
</p>

<p>
If you wish to use another license that is not currently approved by the
Open Source Initiative, let us know and we will review these requests on a
case-by-case basis.
</p>

<p>
It is our intent to provide a permanent home for all versions of your code.
We do reserve the right, however, to terminate your project if there is due
cause, in accordance with the Terms of Service.
</p>");

<b>SourceForge Link</b>
</p>

<p>
If you host a web site at SourceForge, you must place one of our approved
graphic images on your site with a link back to SourceForge. The graphic may
either link to the main SourceForge site or to your project page on
SourceForge. We will leave placement up to you.  For information about how
to insert a SourceForge logo which will track your pageviews, please read
the SourceForge documentation.
