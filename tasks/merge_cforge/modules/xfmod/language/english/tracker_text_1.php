		You can use this system to track virtually any kind of data, with each
		tracker having separate user, group, category, and permission lists. You
		can also easily move items between trackers when needed.
		<p>
		Trackers are referred to as "Artifact Types" and individual pieces of data
		are "Artifacts". "Bugs" might be an Artifact Type, whiles a bug report would be
		an Artifact. You can create as many Artifact Types as you want, but remember
		you need to set up categories, groups, and permission for each type, which
		can get time-consuming.');
